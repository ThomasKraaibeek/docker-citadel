### Citadel Server in Docker  
[Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/million12/citadel) with [Citadel](http://www.citadel.org/doku.php) email server using CentOS-7 and supervisor. It's based on [million12/ssh](https://hub.docker.com/r/million12/ssh/) docker image with `ssh` deamon.

> Citadel is easy, versatile, and powerful, thanks to its exclusive "rooms" based architecture. No other platform seamlessly combines so many different features using this familiar and consistent metaphor.  

###Â Usage
Example `docker run` command:

    docker run \
      -d \
      -h mail.example.org \
      --name mail-server \
      --dns 8.8.8.8 \
      -p 25:25 \
      -p 110:110 \
      -p 143:143 \
      -p 587:587 \
      -p 995:995 \
      -p 80:80 \
      -p 10022:22 \
      --env="PASSWORD=mypassword" \
      --env="DOMAIN=example.org" \
      --env="ATOM_SUPPORT=true" \
      polinux/citadel

### Environmental Variables
In this Image you can use environmental variables to define domain name, admin password, atom editor support and root ssh password.

`ROOT_PASS` = root user password (If not specified image will generate random password which can be retrieved usung `docker logs docker_name` command)  
`PASSWORD` = admin@example.org username password for logging to web interface  
`DOMAIN` = user specified domain name  
`ATOM_SUPPORT` = remote atom support for all of us who are using atom editor (disabled by default)

### Docker troubleshooting


Use docker command to see if all required containers are up and running:

    $ docker ps -a

Check online logs of ssh container:

    $ docker logs ssh

Attach to running ssh container (to detach the tty without exiting the shell,
use the escape sequence Ctrl+p + Ctrl+q):

    $ docker attach ssh

Sometimes you might just want to review how things are deployed inside a running container, you can do this by executing a _bash shell_ through _docker's exec_ command:

    docker exec -i -t ssh /bin/bash

History of an image and size of layers:

    docker history --no-trunc=true million12/ssh | tr -s ' ' | tail -n+2 | awk -F " ago " '{print $2}'
